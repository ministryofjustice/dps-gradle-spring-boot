#2.0.0

This includes an [upgrade to Application Insights Agent v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent)
Note that the environment variables the Application Insights agent accepts have changed. `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_IKEY` is no longer supported.
It can be replaced by `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`, or you can switch to using `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and a connection string
which is the recommended method.
See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string) for details about connection strings.

This also includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.4.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.4.0)
and removing old suppressed vulnerabilities.

Spring Boot 2.4.0 has changed the way in that property files are processed. If you are not ready to update an application to the new way,
legacy mode can be enabled by adding the following to the `application.yml` file,
as mentioned in the [Spring Boot Config Data Migration Guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Config-Data-Migration-Guide):

```
spring:
    config:
       use-legacy-processing: true
```
