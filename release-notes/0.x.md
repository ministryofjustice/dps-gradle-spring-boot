- org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter [3.4.4 - 3.4.6]
# 0.4.7

## Upgrade to spring boot 2.3.2

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.3.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.3.2.RELEASE)

Spring Boot 2.3.2 upgrades to tomcat 9.0.37, so we can have removed pinning of that tomcat version.

## Minor version upgrades

 - com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties:com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties.gradle.plugin [2.2.2 -> 2.2.3]
 - com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin [2.11.0 -> 2.11.1]
# 0.4.6

## Prevent bad versions of tomcat embed core and websocket

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-web` has transitive dependencies `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core -> 9.0.36` and `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-websocket -> 9.0.36`. 

This version contains vulnerabilities as detailed http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13934 and http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13935.
The vulnerability has been fixed in `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core -> 9.0.37` and `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-websocket -> 9.0.37`

This plugin now upgrades to version `9.0.37` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad versions of tomcat embed core and websocket.

## Minor version upgrades

## Prevent bad version of Hibernate-core

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` has transitive dependency `org.hibernate:hibernate-core -> 5.4.17.Final`. 
This version contains a vulnerability as detailed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14900. The vulnerability has been fixed in `org.hibernate:hibernate-core -> 5.4.18.Final` .

This plugin now upgrades to version `5.4.18.Final` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad version of hibernate-core.

## Minor version upgrades

 - org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit [5.8.0.202006091008-r -> 5.8.1.202007141445-r]
 - org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter [3.3.3 -> 3.4.0]

# 0.4.4

## Excluding JUnit 4

We no longer exclude JUnit 4 as part of this plugin as it wasn't compatible with Gradle 6.4.  If you want to exclude it from your project then add the following to your Gradle build file:

```
configurations {
  testImplementation { exclude(mapOf("group" to "org.junit.vintage", "group" to "junit")) }
}
```

This will ensure that code that includes junit `@Test` annotation doesn't compile and also that the junit vintage engine isn't included.
# 0.4.3

## Prevent bad version of reactor netty

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-webflux` has transitive dependency `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty:0.9.8.RELEASE`. This version contains a bug caused problems in production documented in JIRA ticket `DT-983`.  The bug has been fixed in `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty:0.9.9.RELEASE` (see https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/1152).

This plugin now upgrades to version `0.9.9.RELEASE` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad version of reactor-netty.

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.3.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-22).

Specific issues with the Spring Boot upgrade found so far include:

## Property Changes
Be sure to use the [spring-boot-properties-migrator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#configuration-properties) as some properties we use have changed

## Datasource Health Metrics
[Data source health metrics have changed](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#query-less-datasource-health-indicator) - this may break some tests

## Deprecations

### Graceful Shutdown
Spring Boot 2.3.0 now includes its own [graceful shutdown solution](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#graceful-shutdown).  We have retained the old graceful shutdown support (using `com.github.timpeeters:spring-boot-graceful-shutdown:2.2.2`) for time being but please move to the Spring Boot method asap.

### Liveness / Readiness
Spring Boot 2.3.0 now includes its own [liveness and readiness probes]("com.github.timpeeters:spring-boot-graceful-shutdown:2.2.2).  Though we have done nothing yet we will be moving to the Spring probes in the future.  

## Other Issues

### Hibernate
We've noticed a few projects are pinned to an old version of hibernate, e.g. `org.hibernate:hibernate-java8`.  Hibernate is a transitive dependency of Spring JPA - we don't use it directly - so that dependency should be removed to allow Spring JPA to import the correct version of hibernate.

A consequence of upgrading the Hibernate version is that some Hibernate annotations have been removed and should be switched to the javax.validation equivalent.  E.g. `@Length` should be replaced with `@Size`.
