# 1.1.0

This release adds support for kotlin code style and formatting via ktlint.

### Code style & formatting
```bash
./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook
```
will apply ktlint styles to intellij and also add a pre-commit hook to format all changed kotlin files.

Note that the .editorconfig in the root of this project is for this project only, the one in src/main/resources will be copied to other projects to enforce style.

To setup dependent projects with ktlint:
1. (Optional) run the above gradle command to apply to intellij and add the pre commit hook.
2. If you don't plan on making changes to .editorconfig (created on first run) then add to .gitignore.
3. Ensure that the continuous integration tool runs the `check` task instead of `test`.
