## Note for future folks

I looked into upgrading the Gradle Wrapper to 7 in order to fix `com.adarshr.test-logger` issues because the latest version of that plugin doesn't support < 7 

While running tests I got the error
```bash
org.gradle.api.internal.plugins.PluginApplicationException: Failed to apply plugin 'uk.gov.justice.hmpps.gradle-spring-boot'.
Caused by: org.gradle.api.InvalidUserCodeException: Cannot run Project.afterEvaluate(Action) when the project is already evaluated.
```

This will require work to ensure all of the plugins we use are also compatible with Gradle 7, as only this test logging plugin is affected right now it didn't seem worth the lift
