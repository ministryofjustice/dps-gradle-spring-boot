# 3.3.3

## Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.2) which mainly includes bug fixes and version upgrades

## Prevent bad version of spring security

Spring Boot 2.5.2 includes Spring Security 5.5.1 which now causes both the client id and client secret to be url encoded.
This means that any client secrets containing special characters does not work anymore, as the oauth2 provider
doesn't url decode the client id / secret before testing them.

The issue has been raised with Spring Security - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/10018

This plugin now downgrades to version `5.5.0` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Security resolve the problem of url encoding client 
id and client secret

## Version upgrades

Applied jar dependencies:
- spring-boot-gradle-plugin [2.5.0 -> 2.5.2]
