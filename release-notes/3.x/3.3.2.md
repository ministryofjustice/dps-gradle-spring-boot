# 3.3.2

## Revert to Spring Boot 2.5.2 upgrade

A problem has been identified with the upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2, namely client secrets aren't being transmitted correctly to HMPPS Auth.  The upgrade has therefore been reverted until we investigate further and provide a solution.

## Version downgrades

Applied jar dependencies:
- spring-boot-gradle-plugin [2.5.2 -> 2.5.0]
