#3.0.0

This includes an [upgrade to Application Insights Agent v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent).
No new version of the SDK has been released and this remains at 2.6.2. Using SDK 2.6.2 with agent 3.0.0 is a supported configuration.

Note that the environment variables the Application Insights agent accepts have changed. `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_IKEY` is no longer supported.
It can be replaced by `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`, or you can switch to using `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and a connection string
which is the recommended method.
See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string) for details about connection strings.

The configuration file has moved from `AI-Agent.xml` to `applicationinsights.json`.

Attaching the application version number to all traces via the context no longer works - this can be worked around by making `BUILD_NUMBER`
available as an environment variable which is then picked up by the custom dimension configuration below.  The `ContextInitializer` bean
can then be removed.

The `WebTelemetryModule` no longer listens to requests, so can't be used to augment the requests with custom information.
Instead a custom `HandlerInterceptor` has to be added instead to modify the request telemetry.

Minimum suggested configuration file:
```
{
  "role": {
    "name": "application-name"
  },
  "customDimensions": {
    "service.version": "${BUILD_NUMBER}"
  }
}
```
