# 7.0.0

## Breaking changes

### ktlint

This upgrade to Kotlin 2.1.0 breaks the ktlint Spring Boot Plugin as detailed in this issue: https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle/issues/809

To fix this we've upgraded the version of ktlint to the latest version. Unfortunately this causes `ktlintCheck` formatting issues on most projects.

Action required: run command `./gradlew ktlintFormat`

### OpenAPI Specifications

The version of OpenAPI pulled in by Spring (3.1.0) brings some changes that might be breaking depending upon your usage.

Full details on the changes can be found [here](https://dev.to/mikeralphson/openapi-31-the-gnarly-bits-58d0).

#### Known OpenAPI breaking changes

- If you have an `OpenApiCustomizer` relying on the old schema classes, this might have changed to JsonSchema so you'll need a different approach.
- Allowable values declared for enums only works with type `String`, otherwise classes generated from the spec. do not compile.
