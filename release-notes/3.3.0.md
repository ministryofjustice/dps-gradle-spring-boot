# 3.3.0

## Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5

Since this is a minor Spring Boot release there are [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-24) to follow.  `spring.datasource` has been renamed to `spring.sql.init` and `/info` is now protected by default.

To expose `/info` to public add
```
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health,info
```
to your application.yml.  All applications based off the [hmpps-template-kotlin](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-kotlin) will already have the necessary configuration.
