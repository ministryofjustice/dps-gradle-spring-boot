# 5.6.0

This is a fix version for the suppressions file for multi module gradle projects.
It was previously writing the suppressions file to each project directory, this change ensures it gets written
to the root of the multi module directory instead.

There is no change to functionality for non multi module gradle projects as the root and project directories
are the same.
