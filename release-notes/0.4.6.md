## Prevent bad versions of tomcat embed core and websocket

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-web` has transitive dependencies `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core -> 9.0.36` and `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-websocket -> 9.0.36`. 

This version contains vulnerabilities as detailed http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13934 and http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13935.
The vulnerability has been fixed in `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core -> 9.0.37` and `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-websocket -> 9.0.37`

This plugin now upgrades to version `9.0.37` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad versions of tomcat embed core and websocket.
