## Prevent bad version of Hibernate-core

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` has transitive dependency `org.hibernate:hibernate-core -> 5.4.17.Final`. 
This version contains a vulnerability as detailed https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14900. The vulnerability has been fixed in `org.hibernate:hibernate-core -> 5.4.18.Final` .

This plugin now upgrades to version `5.4.18.Final` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad version of hibernate-core.
