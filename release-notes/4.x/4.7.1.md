## Suppress snakeyaml vulnerability (CVE-2022-1471)
Snakeyaml 1.33 has no known upgrade path and is vulnerable to remote code execution. From the CVE:
> SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization.
We're not parsing untrusted YAML so can suppress the vulnerability.

## Suppress h2 vulnerability (CVE-2022-45868)
We only run h2 on local developer laptops so aren't vulnerable to any h2 issues
