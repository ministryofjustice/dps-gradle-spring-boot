## Suppressions
[CVE-2023-4586](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4586) has now been released by NIST.  We now have to suppress all netty packages, not just netty-handler.

### Original suppression text from 4.11.1 release:
[CVE-2023-4586](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-4586) resurrected a 5 year old [issue](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8537) with netty.
This was originally raised as [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)
and then in 2020 as [SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-1042268](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-1042268).

Note that the vulnerability is in the default settings for netty handler.
It is a disputed vulnerability in that if clients configure netty correctly then there is no security issue.

I (Peter Phillips) have [searched](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aministryofjustice%20io.netty.handler.ssl&type=code) our code base and haven't found any
instances of us configuring netty directly.  We instead rely on spring boot and other libraries to handle our connections and connect to other services.
Since the netty issue has been around now for nearly 5 years it is highly unlikely that libraries using netty handler are vulnerable and don't enable
hostname validation.  We can therefore suppress the vulnerability.
