## Attempted upgrade to Kotlin 1.8.20

However faced OOM issues - see [CircleCI build](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ministryofjustice/dps-gradle-spring-boot/1551/workflows/e9fe251c-8054-4b5b-9428-a70f8c7a6b2e/jobs/1769) which is a known issue:
- https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/24815
- https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-51964/Optimize-kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot-feature-to-improve-incremental-Kotlin-compilation

Let's wait for the next version of Kotlin which hopefully won't have these issues
