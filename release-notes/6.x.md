# 6.0.0

## Breaking changes
The spring boot release includes upgrades [Flyway to 10.0](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/release-notes-for-flyway-engine-179732572.html#ReleaseNotesforFlywayEngine-Flyway10.0.0(2023-10-31)), which includes a breaking change for nearly all database users.

Database support has been moved to separate database packages rather than being included in the `flyway-core` package.  The relevant package then needs to be included as well e.g. 
```
  runtimeOnly("org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql")
```
Please see [upgrading from Spring Boot 3.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.3-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-32) for more information.

## Upgrade to Java 21

## Upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.0
This includes an [upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.0](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.0.0/)

This upgrade causes a warning to appear in some projects:
```
'kotlinOptions(KotlinJvmOptionsDeprecated /* = KotlinJvmOptions */.() -> Unit): Unit' is deprecated. Please migrate to the compilerOptions DSL. More details are here: https://kotl.in/u1r8ln
```

To fix the warning change the existing code in `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
     kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_21.toString()
    }
```
to
```kotlin
    compilerOptions.jvmTarget = org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JvmTarget.JVM_21
```
at the top of the file.
