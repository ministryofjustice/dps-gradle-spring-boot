## Removal of Spring Framework DoS suppression
Suppression for CVE-2024-38809 was removed as Spring Framework has now been upgraded.

## Removal of incremental compilation from gradle.properties
When running gradle with incremental compilation the following message appears:
```
History based incremental compilation approach for JVM platform is deprecated and will be removed soon in favor of approach based on ABI snapshots.
Please remove 'kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=false' from 'gradle.properties' file.
```
We have therefore followed the advice and removed that configuration from gradle.properties.

# 6.0.2

## Breaking change
If this upgrade starts breaking tests with error: 

`java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode.is1xxInformational()" because "this.statusCode" is null`

then the likely cause is unit test setup that something like this:

`doThrow(WebClientResponseException.BadGateway::class).whenever(someService).someMethod(anyString())`

The problem is that Mockito doesn't set the status code in the exception but Spring has changed to assume the status code is not null.

To workaround this issue, you can change the test to:

`doThrow(WebClientResponseException.create(HttpStatus.BAD_GATEWAY, "error", HttpHeaders.EMPTY, ByteArray(0), null, null)).whenever(someService).someMethod(anyString())`

# 6.0.1

## Warning

Please ensure that opentelemetry versions are matched with the application insights 3.5.3 and aren't bumped to the latest versions.
The following error was discovered when opentelemetry was upgrade to 1.39 and annotations to 2.5:
```
{"status":500,"userMessage":"Unexpected error: Handler dispatch failed: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClientSecure","developerMessage":"Handler dispatch failed: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class reactor.netty.http.client.HttpClientSecure"}
```

Please note that this plugin automatically includes the correct version of opentelemetry-api so this should not be included as a dependency in your project.

The only opentelemetry implementation dependency you therefore need is:
```
  implementation("io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-annotations:2.4.0")
```

For testing you can also add
```
  testImplementation("io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-sdk-testing:1.38.0")
```

## Upgrade to spring-boot 3.3.1
This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3.1](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.3.1)

## Version Upgrades
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin [3.3.0 -> 3.3.1]
- org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit [:6.9.0.202403050737-r -> 6.10.0.202406032230-r]
- com.microsoft.azure:applicationinsights-core [3.5.2 -> 3.5.3]
- com.microsoft.azure:applicationinsights-agent [3.5.2 -> 3.5.3]
- opentelemetry.version [1.37 -> 1.38]

# 6.0.0

## Breaking changes
The spring boot release includes upgrades [Flyway to 10.0](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/release-notes-for-flyway-engine-179732572.html#ReleaseNotesforFlywayEngine-Flyway10.0.0(2023-10-31)), which includes a breaking change for nearly all database users.

Database support has been moved to separate database packages rather than being included in the `flyway-core` package.  The relevant package then needs to be included as well e.g.
```
  runtimeOnly("org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql")
```
Please see [upgrading from Spring Boot 3.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.3-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-32) for more information.

## H2 and Hibernate for tests
Potential errors similar to the following may occur in the build process:

`Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not prepare statement ...
 Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLSyntaxErrorException: Syntax error in SQL statement ...`

These may potentially be resolved by ensuring hibernate is configured to know that H2 rather than 
postgres is used in the test environment

### application.yml
```yaml
    data:
        jdbc:
            dialect: postgresql
```

### application-test.yml

```yaml
    jpa:
        database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

    data:
        jdbc:
            dialect: h2
```

## Upgrade to Java 21
This is the first release of the plugin to target Java 21 instead of Java 17.

## Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3.0
This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

## Upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.0
This includes an [upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.0](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.0.0/)

This upgrade causes a warning to appear in some projects:
```
'kotlinOptions(KotlinJvmOptionsDeprecated /* = KotlinJvmOptions */.() -> Unit): Unit' is deprecated. Please migrate to the compilerOptions DSL. More details are here: https://kotl.in/u1r8ln
```

To fix the warning change the existing code in `build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
     kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_21.toString()
    }
```
to
```kotlin
    compilerOptions.jvmTarget = org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JvmTarget.JVM_21
```
at the top of the file.
