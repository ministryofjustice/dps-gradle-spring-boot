# 1.0.4

## Sonar project properties

Cloud platform have started scanning our repositories. 
The plugin now adds in a default sonar-project.properties with configuration to ignore coverage 
(since none is collected by cloud platform) and some other issues.  
The properties file is regenerated each time gradle runs, 
but only overwrites the file if the `# WARNING` line at the top of the file is still present.

Unlike the suppression file, this file should be committed to each repository so that it can be picked up by the 
Cloud platform scanning of our github repositories.
