#1.1.2

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.4.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.4.0)
and removing old suppressed vulnerabilities.

[Spring Boot Upgrade guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.4-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-23)

Spring Boot 2.4.0 has changed the way in that property files are processed. If you are not ready to update an application to the new way,
legacy mode can be enabled by adding the following to the `application.yml` file,
as mentioned in the [Spring Boot Config Data Migration Guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Config-Data-Migration-Guide):

```
spring:
    config:
       use-legacy-processing: true
```
