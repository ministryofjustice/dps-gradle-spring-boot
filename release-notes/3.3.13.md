# 3.3.12

## Removal of jcenter repository

This removes jcenter as a repository. In Feb 2021 it was announced that JFrog were planning to shut down JCenter. They
have since decided to keep it as a read-only repository, but 
[Gradle have still marked it as a deprecated repository](https://blog.gradle.org/jcenter-shutdown) so we should still
look to migrate away.

If any projects were relying on packages only in JCenter, they should explicitly include it in the project's 
`build.gradle.kts` like so:

```kotlin
repositories {
  jcenter()
}
```

Or consult Gradle's documentation [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html)
