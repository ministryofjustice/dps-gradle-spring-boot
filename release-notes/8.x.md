# 8.0.0

## Upgrade to spring-boot 3.4.4

This includes an [upgrade to Sprine Boot 3.4.4](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.4.4)

## Upgrade to Kotlin 2.1.20

This includes an [upgrade to Kotlin 2.1.20](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.20/)

## Removal of junit 4 support

Previously this library detected if junit 4 was on the classpath and added in the junit-vintage-engine. This is no
longer the case.
It is recommended that all projects upgrade to junit 5 instead.

## Gradle 9 and test dependencies

Note that as
from [Gradle 8 it is recommended](https://docs.gradle.org/8.2.1/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#test_framework_implementation_dependencies)
to add in

```
  testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher:1.11.4")
```

to your build configuration and this will become an error in Gradle 9.
We have therefore added this dependency automatically, in the same way that we add in `useJUnitPlatform()`. Note that
errors can occur if you have different versions of other junit dependencies on the classpath - we have chosen to pull
in the version that is currently used by spring rather than upgrade to the latest.
This is unrelated to the removal of the junit 4 support.
