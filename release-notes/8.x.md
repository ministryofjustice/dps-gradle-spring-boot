# 8.0.0

## Upgrade to spring-boot 3.4.4
This includes an [upgrade to Sprine Boot 3.4.4](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v3.4.4)

## Upgrade to Kotlin 2.1.20
This includes an [upgrade to Kotlin 2.1.20](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.20/)

## Removal of junit 4 support
Previously this library detected if junit 4 was on the classpath and added in the junit-vintage-engine.  This is no longer the case.
It is recommended that all projects upgrade to junit 5 instead.

## Side note on Gradle 9 and test dependencies
Note that as from [Gradle 8 it is recommended](https://docs.gradle.org/8.2.1/userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#test_framework_implementation_dependencies) to add in 
```
  testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher:1.12.1")
```
to your build configuration and this will become an error in Gradle 9.  This is unrelated to the removal of the junit 4 support, but provided here in case people where wondering about how to fix the new warning.
