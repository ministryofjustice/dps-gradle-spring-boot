## upgrade LOG4J to 2.16.0 due to CVE-2021-45046

[CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) 
https://spring.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot

We have bumped the version of log4j to 2.16.0 to prevent false positives for log4j for this and also CVE-2021-44228.  Note that only log4j-core is actually vulnerable as only that jar file uses log4j to write log messages.

## upgrade Netty to 4.1.72 due to CVE-2021-43797

[CVE-2021-43797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43797) 

Netty prior to version 4.1.7.1.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.7.1.Final to receive a patch.
