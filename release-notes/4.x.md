## Suppressions
[CVE-2023-4586](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4586) has now been released by NIST.  We now have to suppress all netty packages, not just netty-handler.

### Original suppression text from 4.11.1 release:
[CVE-2023-4586](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2023-4586) resurrected a 5 year old [issue](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8537) with netty.
This was originally raised as [CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)
and then in 2020 as [SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-1042268](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-1042268).

Note that the vulnerability is in the default settings for netty handler.
It is a disputed vulnerability in that if clients configure netty correctly then there is no security issue.

I (Peter Phillips) have [searched](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aministryofjustice%20io.netty.handler.ssl&type=code) our code base and haven't found any
instances of us configuring netty directly.  We instead rely on spring boot and other libraries to handle our connections and connect to other services.
Since the netty issue has been around now for nearly 5 years it is highly unlikely that libraries using netty handler are vulnerable and don't enable
hostname validation.  We can therefore suppress the vulnerability.

## Security updates

CVE-2023-1370 affects json-smart 2.4.8.  This is fixed in json-smart 2.4.10.  nimbus-jose-jwt shades json, so we apply
a dependency constraint on it to take it up to 9.24.4.  At the same time we pin oauth2-oidc-sdk to 9.43.1 as both
nimbusds dependencies are linked, and it makes more sense to apply constraints to both at the same time.

CVE-2023-1370 - false positive for accessors-smart 2.4.9. The vulnerability is in json-smart instead.

## Suppress Spring Web 5.3.24 vulnerability (CVE-2016-1000027)
spring-web-5.3.24.jar
can be suppressed as we are not using java serialization and deserialization explicitly

From the CVE:
> Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required.

## False positive suppression for snakeyaml vulnerability (CVE-2022-3064,CVE-2021-4235)

Snakeyaml 1.33 has no known upgrade path and is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks. 

From the CVE:
> Those using Snakeyaml to parse untrusted YAML files may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input,
We're not parsing untrusted YAML so can suppress the vulnerability.

## False positive suppression for json patch vulnerability (CVE-2021-4279)
The vulnerability is in Starcounter-Jack json-patch, not java-json-tools json-patch, therefore this can be suppressed as a false positive.

## Pin netty to latest version 4.1.86.Final
[CVE-2022-41915](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41915)

From the CVE:
> Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with an _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.

## Pin version of spring security

Spring security has been upgraded to 5.7.5 due to CVE-2022-31690:
Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5, and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can modify a request initiated by the Client (via the browser) to the Authorization Server which can lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the Authorization Server responds with an OAuth2 Access Token Response containing an empty scope list (per RFC 6749, Section 5.1) on the subsequent request to the token endpoint to obtain the access token.

## Note for future folks

I looked into upgrading the Gradle Wrapper to 7 in order to fix `com.adarshr.test-logger` issues because the latest version of that plugin doesn't support < 7 

While running tests I got the error
```bash
org.gradle.api.internal.plugins.PluginApplicationException: Failed to apply plugin 'uk.gov.justice.hmpps.gradle-spring-boot'.
Caused by: org.gradle.api.InvalidUserCodeException: Cannot run Project.afterEvaluate(Action) when the project is already evaluated.
```

This will require work to ensure all of the plugins we use are also compatible with Gradle 7, as only this test logging plugin is affected right now it didn't seem worth the lift
# 4.1.1

Add .trivyignore file to suppress (CVE-2020-36518) which requires v2.14 that has not yet been published

The upgrade of org.owasp.dependencycheck requires the hmpps orb to be upgrade in the circleci config.yaml
ministryofjustice/hmpps@3.14 or above should be used
`hmpps: ministryofjustice/hmpps@3.14`
# 4.0.4

## Support Apple Silicon Macs in development
Add io.netty:netty-resolver-dns-native-macos::osx-aarch_64 alongside osx-x86_64 version when building on a Apple Silicon Mac.
CircleCi build would be unaffected given it uses linux.
# 4.0.3

## upgrade Tomcat to 9.0.58 due to CVE-2022-23181

[CVE-2022-23181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23181)

[CVE-2021-44832](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-44832)

We have bumped the version of log4j to 2.17.1 to prevent false positives for log4j for this.  Note that only log4j-core is actually vulnerable as only that jar file uses log4j to write log messages.

## Upgrade notes

We found that it was easier to
- upgrade SpringFox to version 3,
- then upgrade nhaarman.mockitoKotlin2 to mockitoKotlin
- before upgrading the hmpps-gradle-spring-boot plugin

it is possible to do it in one PR, but we found it easier to separate it into 3 due to the number of files that changed

### upgrade SpringFox to version 3,

example of upgrade in hmpps-auth - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth/pull/1103/files

### upgrade nhaarman.mockitoKotlin2 to mockitoKotlin

This update has removed the deprecated mock method `VerifyZeroInteractions`- mockito-kotlin `VerifyNoInteractions` is a replacement.  
Originally the plugin in was using in com.nhaarman.mockitokotlin2:mockito-kotlin:2.2.0 this had been integrated into the official 
Mockito GitHub organisation. This change will mean that imports will need to be updated within your test files if you have been using mockito-kotlin

We used a Global find and replace on

`import org.mockito.Mockito.anyString`
-> `import org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.anyString`

`import org.mockito.Mockito.`
-> `import org.mockito.kotlin.`

`verifyZeroInteractions`
-> `verifyNoInteractions`

`import com.nhaarman.mockitokotlin2`
-> `import org.mockito.kotlin`


### Upgrade to gradle-spring-boot 4.0.0

#### Spring boot 2.6.1

[env info contributor disabled by default](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.6-Release-Notes#actuator-env-infocontributor-disabled-by-default),
We left this disabled but had to update the InfoTest.kt test changing `app.name` to `build.name`


We found that with Spring boot 2.6.1 that ResponseStatusException is no longer returning response body - We have raised an issue with Spring about this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/28953

_“The newly introduced ErrorPageSecurityFilter is built on the assumption that Spring Security will behave consistently in terms of the authentication that's available when a request is forwarded. The assumption doesn't hold true when using a bearer token”_

A work around for this is to create your own exception handler, which is used instead of the ResponseStatusException, this can then return the exception along with the error body as required.

#### Using Quartz Jobs
If specifying the jobs store class as `org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX` and not providing required datasource name, Spring 2.5 would forgive this and provide a default. This has now been removed in Spring 2.6, breaking the application.

[This issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27709) was raised with spring and provides a few different solutions in order to resolve the problem caused by the upgrade.

#### Elasticsearch
If you are using elasticsearch – Spring boot 2.6.1 updates the spring-data-elasticsearch to 4.3.0
this pulls in rest-high-level-client:7.15.1

The rest-high-level-client and version of elastic search now need to aligned - [see elastic/elasticsearch#76091](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/76091#issuecomment-892817267)

Therefore, we had to pin the version of elasticsearch to 7.12.1
and spring-data-elasticsearch to 4.2.7
