# 0.4.3

## Prevent bad version of reactor netty

Spring Boot 2.3.1 starter `spring-boot-starter-webflux` has transitive dependency `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty:0.9.8.RELEASE`. This version contains a bug caused problems in production documented in JIRA ticket `DT-983`.  The bug has been fixed in `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty:0.9.9.RELEASE` (see https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/1152).

This plugin now upgrades to version `0.9.9.RELEASE` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Boot no longer imports the bad version of reactor-netty.
