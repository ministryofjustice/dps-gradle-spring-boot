##Upgrade notes

We found that it was easier to
- upgrade SpringFox to version 3,
- then upgrade nhaarman.mockitoKotlin2 to mockitoKotlin
- before upgrading the hmpps-gradle-spring-boot plugin

it is possible to do it in one PR, but we found it easier to separate it into 3 due to the number of files that changed

###upgrade SpringFox to version 3,

example of upgrade in hmpps-auth - https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth/pull/1103/files

###upgrade nhaarman.mockitoKotlin2 to mockitoKotlin

This update has removed the deprecated mock method `VerifyZeroInteractions`- mockito-kotlin `VerifyNoInteractions` is a replacement.  
Originally the plugin in was using in com.nhaarman.mockitokotlin2:mockito-kotlin:2.2.0 this had been integrated into the official 
Mockito GitHub organisation. This change will mean that imports will need to be updated within your test files if you have been using mockito-kotlin

We used a Global find and replace on

`import org.mockito.Mockito.anyString`
-> `import org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.anyString`

`import org.mockito.Mockito.`
-> `import org.mockito.kotlin.`

`verifyZeroInteractions`
-> `verifyNoInteractions`

`import com.nhaarman.mockitokotlin2`
-> `import org.mockito.kotlin`


###Upgrade to gradle-spring-boot 4.0.0

####Spring boot 2.6.1
We found that with Spring boot 2.6.1 that ResponseStatusException is no longer returning response body - We have raised an issue with Spring about this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/28953

_“The newly introduced ErrorPageSecurityFilter is built on the assumption that Spring Security will behave consistently in terms of the authentication that's available when a request is forwarded. The assumption doesn't hold true when using a bearer token”_

A work around for this is to create your own exception handler, which is used instead of the ResponseStatusException, this can then return the exception along with the error body as required.

####Elasticsearch
If you are using elasticsearch – Spring boot 2.6.1 updates the spring-data-elasticsearch to 4.3.0
this pulls in rest-high-level-client:7.15.1

The rest-high-level-client and version of elastic search now need to aligned - [see elastic/elasticsearch#76091](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/76091#issuecomment-892817267)

Therefore, we had to pin the version of elasticsearch to 7.12.1
and spring-data-elasticsearch to 4.2.7
