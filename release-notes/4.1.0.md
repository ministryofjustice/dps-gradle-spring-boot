# 4.1.0

## Switch from the existing ktLint linter plugin to use Kotlinter instead

As https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle now contains a security issue, and the project is looking for new
maintainers, we have switched to https://github.com/jeremymailen/kotlinter-gradle .

This plugin installs the checking and formatting githook on push rather than on commit. If there are lint errors, the source is formatted and the push blocked. The formatting changes can then be committed manually.

It requires JAVA_HOME to be in the environment or java in the path.
Although the old githook required the same, it did not block a commit when it failed due to this environment setting being missing.

Now however, the push is blocked if this is not set up.

Note also you may need to delete the old githook `<project-dir>/.git/hooks/pre-commit`
