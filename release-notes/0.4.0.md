# 0.4.0

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.3.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-22).

Specific issues with the Spring Boot upgrade found so far include:

## Property Changes
Be sure to use the [spring-boot-properties-migrator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#configuration-properties) as some properties we use have changed

## Datasource Health Metrics
[Data source health metrics have changed](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#query-less-datasource-health-indicator) - this may break some tests

## Deprecations

### Graceful Shutdown
Spring Boot 2.3.0 now includes its own [graceful shutdown solution](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.3-Release-Notes#graceful-shutdown).  We have retained the old graceful shutdown support (using `com.github.timpeeters:spring-boot-graceful-shutdown:2.2.2`) for time being but please move to the Spring Boot method asap.

### Liveness / Readiness
Spring Boot 2.3.0 now includes its own [liveness and readiness probes]("com.github.timpeeters:spring-boot-graceful-shutdown:2.2.2).  Though we have done nothing yet we will be moving to the Spring probes in the future.  

## Other Issues

### Hibernate
We've noticed a few projects are pinned to an old version of hibernate, e.g. `org.hibernate:hibernate-java8`.  Hibernate is a transitive dependency of Spring JPA - we don't use it directly - so that dependency should be removed to allow Spring JPA to import the correct version of hibernate.

A consequence of upgrading the Hibernate version is that some Hibernate annotations have been removed and should be switched to the javax.validation equivalent.  E.g. `@Length` should be replaced with `@Size`.
