# 4.1.4

## Upgrade to Kotlin 1.6.20

This includes an [upgrade to Kotlin 1.6.20](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.6.20).

## Version upgrades
 - net.javacrumbs.json-unit:json-unit-assertj [2.32.0 -> 2.33.0]
 - org.owasp:dependency-check-gradle [7.0.3 -> 7.0.4.1]

## Pinning removal

We no longer need to ping net.logstash.logback:logstash-logback-encoder to 7.0.1 as spring now references the newer version.

## False positive suppression

We've had to suppress a number of spring framework false positives - see https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/4351
