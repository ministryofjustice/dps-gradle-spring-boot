# 0.4.4

## Excluding JUnit 4

We no longer exclude JUnit 4 as part of this plugin as it wasn't compatible with Gradle 6.4.  If you want to exclude it from your project then add the following to your Gradle build file:

```
configurations {
  testImplementation { exclude(mapOf("group" to "org.junit.vintage", "group" to "junit")) }
}
```

This will ensure that code that includes junit `@Test` annotation doesn't compile and also that the junit vintage engine isn't included.
