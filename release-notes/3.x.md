## Removed the pinned version of Spring Security 5.5.0

hmpps-auth (our oauth2 provider) is now able to url decode the client id / secret before testing them.
This removes the issue we had with Spring Security 5.5.1 url encoding client id and client secret.
Spring Boot 2.5.2 is now able to pull in Spring Security 5.5.1

## Version upgrades

## Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2

This includes an [upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.2) which mainly includes bug fixes and version upgrades

## Prevent bad version of spring security

Spring Boot 2.5.2 includes Spring Security 5.5.1 which now causes both the client id and client secret to be url encoded.
This means that any client secrets containing special characters does not work anymore, as the oauth2 provider
doesn't url decode the client id / secret before testing them.

The issue has been raised with Spring Security - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/10018

This plugin now downgrades to version `5.5.0` automatically.

Note that the automatic upgrade will need to be removed once Spring Security resolve the problem of url encoding client 
id and client secret

## Version upgrades

Applied jar dependencies:
- spring-boot-gradle-plugin [2.5.0 -> 2.5.2]


# 3.3.2

## Revert to Spring Boot 2.5.2 upgrade

A problem has been identified with the upgrade to Spring Boot 2.5.2, namely client secrets aren't being transmitted correctly to HMPPS Auth.  The upgrade has therefore been reverted until we investigate further and provide a solution.

## Version downgrades

Applied jar dependencies:
- spring-boot-gradle-plugin [2.5.2 -> 2.5.0]
# 3.3.16

## upgrade LOG4J to 2.16.0 due to CVE-2021-45046

[CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) 
https://spring.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot

We have bumped the version of log4j to 2.16.0 to prevent false positives for log4j for this and also CVE-2021-44228.  Note that only log4j-core is actually vulnerable as only that jar file uses log4j to write log messages.

## upgrade Netty to 4.1.72 due to CVE-2021-43797

[CVE-2021-43797](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43797) 

Netty prior to version 4.1.7.1.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another remote system when used as proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.7.1.Final to receive a patch.
# 3.3.15

## upgrade LOG4J to 2.15.0 due to CVE-2021-44228

[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) 
https://spring.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot

With the OWASP dependency check now flagging the 2.14.1 version of log4j as vulnerable 
we have bumped the version of log4j to 2.15.0 to prevent this and other vulnerability 
scanning software flagging log4j as having the vulnerability. 
we have removed the .trivyignore file as no longer needed 
# 3.3.14

Add .trivyignore file to suppress false positive for log4j.api (CVE-2021-44228)
https://spring.io/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-vulnerability-and-spring-boot

The .trivyignore file will need to be added to your repository so that the Trivy scan job will pick it up

# 3.3.13

## Removal of jcenter repository

This removes jcenter as a repository. In Feb 2021 it was announced that JFrog were planning to shut down JCenter. They
have since decided to keep it as a read-only repository, but 
[Gradle have still marked it as a deprecated repository](https://blog.gradle.org/jcenter-shutdown) so we should still
look to migrate away.

If any projects were relying on packages only in JCenter, they should explicitly include it in the project's 
`build.gradle.kts` like so:

```kotlin
repositories {
  jcenter()
}
```

Or consult Gradle's documentation [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html)

Since this is a minor Spring Boot release there are [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.5-Release-Notes#upgrading-from-spring-boot-24) to follow.  `spring.datasource` has been renamed to `spring.sql.init` and `/info` is now protected by default.

To expose `/info` to public add
```
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health,info

# 3.0.0

This includes an [upgrade to Application Insights Agent v3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent).
No new version of the SDK has been released and this remains at 2.6.2. Using SDK 2.6.2 with agent 3.0.0 is a supported configuration.

Note that the environment variables the Application Insights agent accepts have changed. `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_IKEY` is no longer supported.
It can be replaced by `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`, or you can switch to using `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and a connection string
which is the recommended method.
See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string) for details about connection strings.

The configuration file has moved from `AI-Agent.xml` to `applicationinsights.json`.

Attaching the application version number to all traces via the context no longer works - this can be worked around by making `BUILD_NUMBER`
available as an environment variable which is then picked up by the custom dimension configuration below.  The `ContextInitializer` bean
can then be removed.

The `WebTelemetryModule` no longer listens to requests, so can't be used to augment the requests with custom information.
Instead a custom `HandlerInterceptor` has to be added instead to modify the request telemetry.
See https://github.com/ministryofjustice/offender-case-notes/pull/134/files for an example PR with the upgrade changes required, with
extra fixes for custom dimensions in https://github.com/ministryofjustice/offender-case-notes/pull/139/files.

Minimum suggested configuration file:
```
{
  "role": {
    "name": "application-name"
  },
  "customDimensions": {
    "service.version": "${BUILD_NUMBER}"
  },
  "instrumentation": {
    "logging": {
      "level": "DEBUG"
    }
  },
  "selfDiagnostics": {
    "destination": "console"
  }
}
```
